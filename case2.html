            All successful leaders take the time to think and examine their values and beliefs. Over time, their beliefs are put to the test and adjusted. True leaders aren't afraid to state their beliefs and the reasons behind them. They don't require a teleprompter to be reminded of their fundamental principles. And even when they are aware that others may disagree, they muster the confidence to speak up.
<p class="secondText">Every executive who had complained about the session in private stood when the consultants went around the room and said, "In." Fourth from the bottom was Weaver. He yelled "Out" when it was his turn and walked out of the room.</p>

              <li>Peter Weaver dislikes going with the flow. He believes that groupthink is a widespread issue in lots of organisations. Differences of opinion, according to this former director of marketing for a consumer products company, should be heard and valued. "I have always thought I should speak up for what I think is true, as Weaver puts it."</li></p>

              <p class="thirdText"><li>Throughout his career, he showed that he believed in being straightforward and honest. He had had the responsibility of promoting Paul's spaghetti sauces. The firm president stated, "Our spaghetti sauce is losing out to competitors with lower prices, during the brand evaluation. We must lower our prices!</li></p>
              
              <p class="thirdText"><li>Peter had the guts to express his disapproval of the president. The product line, he said, required more diversity and a bigger advertising budget. Pricing shouldn't be decreased. The president agreed with Weaver's justification. "I wanted to say it, but I just didn't have the nerve to contradict the president," his supervisor stated when she saw him later.</li></p>

              <p class="thirdText"><li>The president once again invited Weaver and 16 other executives to a weeklong strategic planning conference. Weaver quickly came to the conclusion that the consultants were erroneous and taking the wrong turn. Most of the other executives made it known between sessions that they didn't believe the consultants were heading in the right direction. After learning of the dissension, the consultants asked participants dramatically if they were in or out. Those who yelled "Out" were required to leave right away.</li></p>
