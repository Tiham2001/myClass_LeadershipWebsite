              <li>Five major aspects that may affect the transfer of leadership training are presented in the paper based on a survey of the research. These served as the direction for an exploratory, qualitative investigation. 18 participants in a comprehensive, soft skill-focused leadership development programme were interviewed, along with peer observers. In order to assess and validate qualitative findings, quantitative analyses are performed whenever practical. Findings The findings indicated significant training transfer and suggest that actual skill use is affected differently from assessments of the instruction's worth. Fear of defying cultural norms and its most crucial treatment, the quantity of other managers who obtain the training, found to be the biggest transfer inhibitors.</li></p>

              <p class="thirdText"><li>Having one's employer attend the same training in particular was significantly linked to post-training use. Positive evaluations of the training were linked to certain social support behaviours, such as verbal encouragement and praise, but not use. Instead, peer coaching and observation of others using the skills were the kind of "help" that actually led to utilisation; however, this was only possible if managers and coworkers had already received the training. limits and implications of the study The study is an exploratory case study, therefore it lacks the kind of technique that would demonstrate the veracity of the results and a large sample size.</li></p>
              
              <p class="thirdText"><li>Real-world applications Several consequences are explored for training managers who wish to make sure their leadership development programmes have a genuine impact. In particular, the study emphasises the necessity of scheduling leadership development courses concurrently with mechanisms for rapid training diffusion and cultural transformation. Originality/value According to experts like Cheng and Ho, the publication fills a need for empirical investigation of aspects related to the transfer of soft skills into the workplace. It points out disparities between what influences value assessments and what actually influences transfer. Additionally, it highlights the fact that altering leadership behaviour requires both a cultural intervention and a shift in skill sets.</li></p>
