    <section class="secondPart">
        <p class="secondText">Research has shown that work-life balance is a key element in employee engagement and retention. Some employees struggle with time management and blurring the lines between their personal and professional lives, which leads to burnout and a decline in their physical and mental well-being.</p>
        <p class="secondText">  Their work performance suffers as a result, which is a problem that needs to be resolved.  </p>
        <p class="secondText"> You may help your employees and coworkers determine their priorities and give them security in knowing that the company is concerned about their overall well-being by holding a training session on work-life balance.

              <li>Managing Change
                The only thing that is consistent in our fast-paced world is change. A successful job and a fulfilling home life both depend on your ability to constantly embrace new strategies and adapt existing ones. Effective change management is making consistent, concerted efforts to prevent being overwhelmed or defeated by the volume and pace of change at work and at home.
            </li></p>

              <p class="thirdText"><li>Managing Technology
                Make sure technology works for you, not against you. Ever since the invention of the wheel, flint, spear, and walking stick, technology has been a part of our lives. Vendors looking to gain a larger piece of the market are causing the rate of change to quicken. Keeping up with the Joneses in terms of technology is frequently necessary, but you should dominate technology rather than the other way around.
            </li></p>
              
              <p class="thirdText"><li>Organizing free time
                This is the aspect of work-life balance that is most frequently ignored. The importance of rest and relaxation cannot be understated. A crucial aspect of the human experience is downtime. Strangely, monotony can result from engaging in the same leisure activity again, no matter how much you enjoy it. In order to manage your free time effectively, you must mix up your activities.
            </li></p>
              
              <p class="thirdText"><li>Self-management
                It can be difficult to manage oneself adequately, especially when it comes to getting enough rest, exercise, and diet. Self-management is the acceptance that making the best use of the given time, resources, and life is essential. It entails taking the helm of our own ships. Nobody is coming to help you steer.</li></p>
